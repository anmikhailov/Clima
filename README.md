## About this app
This is a beautiful, dark-mode enabled weather app. You'll be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually.
##### In this app I use:
* UIKit/programmatically layout.
* Dark Mode.
* Vector images as image assets.
* Apple's SF Symbols.
* Protocols and delegates. Delegate pattern.
* Extensions.
* Networking with URL session and HTTP requests.
* Parsing JSON data with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols.
* Core Location to get the current location from the phone GPS.
